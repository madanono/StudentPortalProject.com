									<h2>Matric</h2>
<p>The National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations commonly referred to as “matric” has become an annual event of major public significance. It not only signifies the culmination of twelve years of formal schooling but the NSC examinations is a barometer of the health of the education system.

	Do you need credits in order to obtain your National Senior Certificate (NSC) because you did not meet the minimum pass requirements in previous examination sittings? Did you complete the CASS (continuous assessment)/ SBA (School Based Assessment) component for all the subjects for which you have written the final external Grade 12 examinations? You can enrol for the subjects that you wish to repeat without having to redo the CASS component.</p>
